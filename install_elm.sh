#
curl -L -o elm.gz https://github.com/elm/compiler/releases/download/0.19.1/binary-for-linux-64-bit.gz

# The downloaded file is compressed to make it faster to download.
# This next command decompresses it, replacing `elm.gz` with `elm`.
#
gunzip elm.gz

# There should now be a file named `elm` on your Desktop!
#
# Every file has "permissions" about whether it can be read, written, or executed.
# So before we use this file, we need to mark this file as executable:
#
chmod +x elm

# Now it should be possible to run the `elm` binary just by saying its name!
#
elm --help
